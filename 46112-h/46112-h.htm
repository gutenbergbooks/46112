THE DARK AGES</h2>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Men</span> call you
&ldquo;dark.&rdquo;&nbsp; What factory then blurred the light<br
/>
Of golden suns, when nothing blacker than the shades<br />
Of coming rain climbed up the heather-mantled height?<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
While the air<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Breathed all the scents of all untrodden flowers,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; And brooks poured silver through the glimmering
glades,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then sweetly wound through virgin
ground.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Must all that
beauty pass?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And must our
pleasure trains<br />
Like foul eruptions belch upon the mountain head?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Must we perforce build vulgar villa lanes,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And on sweet
fields of grass<br />
The canting scutcheons of a cheating commerce spread?</p>
<p class="poetry">Men call you &ldquo;dark.&rdquo;&nbsp; Did that
faith see with cobwebbed eyes,<br />
That built the airy octagon on Ely&rsquo;s hill,<br />
And Gloucester&rsquo;s Eastern wall that woos the topaz skies,<br
/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>Where the
hymn<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Angelic &ldquo;Glory be to God on
high,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And peace on earth to men who feel
good will,&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Might softly
sound God&rsquo;s throne around?<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Is that a perfect faith<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Which pew-filled chapels rears,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where Gothic fronts of stone mask backs of ill-baked
bricks,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And where the frothy fighting
preacher fears,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
As peasants fear a wraith,<br />
His deacon&rsquo;s frown or some just change in politics?</p>
<p class="poetry">Men call you &ldquo;dark.&rdquo;&nbsp; Was
Chaucer&rsquo;s speech a muddy stream,<br />
The language born of Norman sun and Saxon snow?<br />
Was Langland&rsquo;s verse or Wyclif&rsquo;s prose mere
glow-worm&rsquo;s gleam?<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
And the tales<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of Arthur&rsquo;s sword and of the
holy Grail,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And Avalon, the isle where no
storms blow:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From such
romance did no light glance?<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Have we not heard a tongue,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Whose words the Saxon thralls<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Would scorn to speak above their muck-rake and their
fork,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The speech of barrack-rooms and
music-halls,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Where every fool has flung<br />
The rotten refuse of Calcutta and New York?</p>

His hands that worked in love were torn with red,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He shrank not at the sight,<br />
For he who suffered saw a Heart that bled<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Become his beacon-light.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus brother to the Son of God<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With life from heaven on earth he trod:<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; The Shepherd knows a way.</p>
<p class="poetry">Far, and how far it is not mine to guess,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A sea of hungry waves<br />
Surrounds me, but the Pilot thwarts their stress<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With skill that guides and saves.</p>
<p class="poetry">Far, and how far is all unknown to me,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The many mansions lie<br />
Beyond the grave, yet will the Builder see<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And come to meet my cry.</p>

one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project

charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
